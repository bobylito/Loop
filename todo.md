# Loop

An animation system : the todo

## Features
 [+] Particles : Image data rendering
 [ ] Control time
 [ ] animation context
 [ ] Pluggable IO on animation system

## Cleanup 
 [-] Remove datastore
 [-] Main loop as a function to be used multiple time

## Investigate 
 [ ] Particle system over time (pure function, reproductibility)?
 [+] Rendering engine with filled line and curve => boring...
